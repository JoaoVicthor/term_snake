# 🐍 term_snake 🐍
A python implementation of the classic snake game running in your terminal.
Made for the fun of it, as simple as it gets.

It only depends on the *keyboard* lib.
`pip3 install keyboard`

To execute the game:
`sudo python3 snake.py`

Use `W A S D` to control your snek 🐍

I wish it could be run without **sudo**...
