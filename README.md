# 🐍 term_snake 🐍
A python implementation of the classic snake game running in your terminal.
Made for the fun of it, as simple as it gets.

To execute the game:
`python3 snake.py`

Use `W A S D` or `arrow keys` to control your snek 🐍

Watchout for the ghost! 👻

~~I wish it could be run without **sudo**...~~
It no longer relies on the `keyboard` library.
It's been since implemented using `ncurses` for input processing and UI.
